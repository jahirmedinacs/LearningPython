|[Home](/index.md)|[Introduction to Python](/Python.md)|[Introduction to SciPy](/SciPy.md)|

We are a group of friends learning python from a collection of good videos from YouTube, obviously, all the content of those videos will be complemented with the official [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) in order to obtain a complete view of the potential of those tools. In addition, we will develop an introduction to the Python-based scientific ecosystem called [SciPy](https://scipy.org/). The aim of this group is to learn the tools for the development of computational physics (solutions, data analysis, simulations, etc.) in python.
