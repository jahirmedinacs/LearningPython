# LearningPython

We are learning python from a collection of very good videos from the channel of [Keith Galli](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFCB5Dp81iNVoB_eWmDB1nEusSCurrsac). Please follow him, he has a remarkable content. 

The aim of this group is to learn the tools for the development of computational physics (solutions, data analysis, simulations, etc.) in python without having to pay for an expensive online course, the online title that you need is you physics degree.
