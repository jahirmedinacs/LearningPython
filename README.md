# LearningPython

We are a group of friends learning python from a collection of good videos from the channels of [Keith Galli](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFCB5Dp81iNVoB_eWmDB1nEusSCurrsac) and [Pildoras inform√°ticas (Spanish)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU8oAlHdN5BlvPxziopYZRd55pdqFwkeS), obviously, all the content of those videos will be complemented with the official [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) in order to obtain a complete view of the potential of these tools. In addition, we will develop an introduction to the Python-based scientific ecosystem called [SciPy](https://scipy.org/). The aim of this group is to learn the tools for the development of computational physics (solutions, data analysis, simulations, etc.) in python without having to pay for an online course, the online title you need is your physics degree.
