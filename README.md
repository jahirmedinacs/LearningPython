# LearningPython

We are a group of friends learning python from a collection of good videos from the channel of [Keith Galli](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFCB5Dp81iNVoB_eWmDB1nEusSCurrsac) and [Pildoras inform√°ticas (Spanish)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU8oAlHdN5BlvPxziopYZRd55pdqFwkeS). In addition, all the content of these videos will be complemented with the official [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) to obtain a complete view of the potential of these tools. The aim of this group is to learn the tools for the development of computational physics (solutions, data analysis, simulations, etc.) in python without having to pay for an online course, the online title you need is your physics degree.
