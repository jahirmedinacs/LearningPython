# Introduction to SciPy

Here we have the principal branches of SciPy: 
* **[NumPy](https://numpy.org/)**: This package allows us to work with N-dimensional arrays
* **[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)**: With this package we can elaborate 2-dimensional plots
* **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)**: Very important package for developing data analysis.
